# What it does
SeaShell allows users to create a highly personalized research/personal/educational projects and document their progress on our site. SeaShell users have the ability to view projects made by other users, along with creating their own project and posting highly customizable reports within it.

# Inspiration
Our team was inspired by the lack of knowledge we had regarding the environment and ongoing ecological events. We wanted to create a platform that could inform the general public about saving the environment.

# How we built it
We built backend of SeaShell using Node.js hosted on the repl.it online IDE. We used APIs such as Google Firebase, Tiny MCE text editor, and socket.io for the backend.

The frontend of SeaShell was built using an online HTML CSS builder with export capabilities called TeleportHQ. Figma was also used to import our original logo.

# Challenges we ran into
We ran into multiple challenges troubleshooting the backend and ensuring all post/project information was saved and displayed on the screen. The frontend also ran into problems with formatting, hovers, and overall design.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of having a fully functional site with little to no bugs. We were also able to implement our core functionalities with posting/viewing projects.

# What we learned
We learned a lot about backend programming and sending and retrieving information to and from a database.

# What's next for SeaShell
There are still multiple features that SeaShell could use, especially more features promoting interaction between posters/viewers. These features could make SeaShell easier and more fun to use for users.
